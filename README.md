# Metabase Arrow Flight SQL Driver

A Clojure library that enables Metabase to connect to databases using the Apache Arrow Flight SQL JDBC driver. This driver integrates Arrow Flight SQL into Metabase, delivering enhanced performance and advanced SQL querying capabilities.

My main goal was to allow Metabase to use [Spice.ai OSS](https://spiceai.org/docs) as a cache layer.

## Features

- JDBC-based integration: Leverages the Apache Arrow Flight SQL JDBC driver.
- Flexible configuration: Supports custom connection properties such as host, port, user, password, token, and encryption.
- Custom Schema Sync: Implements table and column description methods for seamless Metabase integration.
- Timestamp Conversion: Automatically converts TIMESTAMP columns to local date-time objects.
- Field Filters: Full support for Metabase field filters including table aliases for JOIN queries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Podman (https://podman.io/) – for container management.
- Python 3 – for running the automated setup script.
- Leiningen (https://leiningen.org/) – optional, for local builds (the docker-compose handles this automatically).

### Quick Start

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/J0hnG4lt/metabase-flightsql-driver.git
   cd metabase-flightsql-driver
   ```

2. Start all services

   ```bash
   podman compose up -d
   ```

3. Wait for Metabase to be ready (takes ~1-2 minutes for JAR build + Metabase startup)

   ```bash
   # Check if Metabase is ready
   podman exec metabase curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

4. Run the automated setup script

   ```bash
   python scripts/metabase_setup.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Perform initial Metabase setup (creates admin user)
   - Create an API key for automation
   - Configure database connections (GizmoSQL and Spice.ai)
   - Create a comprehensive test dashboard with 32 cards and 5 field filters

5. Open Metabase at http://localhost:3000
   - Email: `admin@metabase.local`
   - Password: `Metabase123!`

### Building the Driver Manually

If you prefer to build locally:

```bash
lein uberjar
```

The docker-compose file also contains a builder service, so don't worry if you have issues when installing lein and clojure.

## Docker Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| metabase | 3000 | Metabase BI tool |
| postgres | 5432 | Metabase application database |
| spiced | 50051, 8090, 9090 | Spice.ai Flight SQL server |
| gizmosql | 31337 | GizmoSQL Flight SQL server (DuckDB-based) |
| builder | - | Builds the driver JAR |

## Configuration

When setting up the connection in Metabase, the driver registers under the name `:arrow-flight-sql` with `:sql-jdbc` as its parent. The main configuration properties include:

- **Host**: (Default: localhost) – The server's hostname or IP address.
- **Port**: (Default: 443) – The port to use for the connection.
- **User**: (Optional) – Username for authentication.
- **Password**: (Optional) – Password for authentication.
- **Token**: (Optional) – A secure token for connection (used by Spice.ai).
- **Catalog**: (Optional) - The name of the catalog to use.
- **Use Encryption**: (Default: true) – Enable or disable connection encryption.

## End-to-End Testing

The project includes comprehensive end-to-end testing:

```bash
# Clean start (removes all data)
podman compose down -v
podman compose up -d

# Wait for Metabase, then run setup
python scripts/metabase_setup.py
```

The setup script creates a test dashboard with:
- **32 cards** with various chart types (scalar, bar, pie, line, area, table, gauge, funnel, scatter, progress)
- **5 field filters** (Order Status, Country, Department, Marketing Channel, Date Range)
- **3 test schemas** in GizmoSQL (sales, hr, analytics)

### Claude Code Integration

If using Claude Code, run `/e2e-test` for guided end-to-end testing instructions.

## Features Tested

- SQL Native queries
- Graphical query editor
- Database syncs
- Field filters (single table and JOINs with table aliases)
- Dashboard rendering with multiple concurrent queries
- Connection pooling stability
- Date/time type handling

## Troubleshooting

### Check Metabase logs
```bash
podman logs metabase 2>&1 | tail -100
```

### Check connection pool status
```bash
podman logs metabase 2>&1 | grep "connections:"
```

### Rebuild driver after code changes
```bash
podman compose down metabase builder
podman compose up -d builder
# Wait ~30 seconds for build
podman compose up -d metabase
```

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was built with help from ChatGPT and Claude Code, along with reference to the Metabase repository and several of its existing drivers. While I'm not a Clojure developer by background, these tools made development much more approachable.
